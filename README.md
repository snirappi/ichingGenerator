# ichingGenerator

Prints iching Hexagrams with hexagram number and changed lines

## Binary Search Tree Lookup

This program creates a BST that describes a path to each Hexagram by searching line-by-line for a given hexagram.
Each line will cause navigation down the left or right node depending on if the line is broken or unbroken. This is repeated until we have gone through every line.
